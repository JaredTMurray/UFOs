# UFOs
## Overview of Project: 
This overview goes in-depth analysing UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. I used app.js and index.html to build users input to go through the table of UFO sightings. 


## Deliverable 1 Instructions
I have used the HTML file, [index.html](https://github.com/JaredTMurray/UFOs/blob/main/index.html) and linked it to the Javascript file, [app.js](https://github.com/JaredTMurray/UFOs/blob/main/js/app.js). In addition to the date filter I created in this module, I added filters for the city, state, country, and shape. I modified the search through the table in my index.html file. This created more table filters. The app.js file function updateFilters(), saves the ids of the filter in the variable filterId and applied it through the rows of the table and also cleared the values in the variable filters. The function then calls filterTable() function to put in the values in the html table. 


## Results: 
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

## Summary: 
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
